Through the Asian Lion Dance Team, Kong’s Siu Lum Pai and personal interest I’ve been able to help out with many community events.  For Kong’s Siu Lum Pai I’ve been able to participate in Chinese New Year demonstrations at Cultural Plaza in front of crowds of many spectators .  And participate in celebrations at local malls around the island and grand openings for different types of stores, restaurants and attractions.  And through the Asian Lion Dance Team, I’ve been able to participate in many various events: working at a food station for a volleyball tournament at one of the local stadiums, helping set up, run, and entertain various customers at small carnivals at schools and the Mililani Town Center, political events and participating in various parades, locally viewed and internationally viewed hosted here in Oahu.  Also I’ve volunteered at the Honolulu Comic Con in the Tech Department which was a nice experience doing something leaning torwards entertainment.  So I’ve been able to work with various types of people, experiencing different types of jobs and for the most part had lots of fun doing it, whether it was from being in a leadership position, helping out where I can, or even just watching and learning for the next time.
